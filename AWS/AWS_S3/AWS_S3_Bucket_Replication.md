# Bucket Replication 

S3 replication is a feature that allows objects in one bucket (the source) to be automatically copied to another bucket (the destination) in the same or different AWS regions.


Types of Replication

- Cross-Region Replication (CRR) – Replicates data to a bucket in a different AWS region for disaster recovery, latency optimization, or compliance.

- Same-Region Replication (SRR) – Replicates data within the same region for use cases like logging, compliance, or maintaining a secondary copy.

Key Points
- Requires versioning to be enabled on both source and destination buckets.
- Replication is asynchronous, so there might be a small delay.
- Supports replicating new objects, object metadata, ACLs, and tags.
- Can filter replication by prefix or tags.
- Works with KMS encryption, but needs additional permissions.

Benefits

- Disaster Recovery – Data is safe even if one region goes down.
- Compliance – Storing data in specific regions to meet legal or corporate requirements.
- Low-Latency Access – Keeping a copy closer to users in different geographies.
- Backup & Redundancy – Maintaining a secure secondary copy.


### Pre-requites 
- 2 Buckets (One for Source and one for destination )
- Same or Different Region
- enable versioning on source and destination bucket
- IAM role for replication for source & destination bucket
- replicaation rule

Step 1. Create 2 Bucktes

Step 2. Go to your first (Original) Bucket store data and click on Management

Step 3. Scroll Down find Replication rules click on Create replication rule

Step 4. Create replication rule

Step 5. Source bucket

---

Step 6. Select Destination Bucket where you want to copy data

- Select Destination bucket name

---

Step 7. IAM Role Click on Create new role

---
Step 8. Replicate existing objects? Click on Yes, replicate existing objects. and Submit

---

Step 9. Create Batch Operations job

---
Step 11. Now you Successfully created batch operations and wait for some time

---
Step 12. Check you newly created bucket (Destination) you will see all data are successfully copied form old bucket (source)

## if you add any data in old bucket s3 will automatically copy that file into new bucket
